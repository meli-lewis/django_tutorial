# Code following official Django 2.0 tutorial: Writing your first Django app

If you've yet to download Django, go to their [install directions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/install/) first! The tutorial immediately follows.

Each commit (other than `initial commit`) follows immediately from my completion of a specific part of the tutorial. Note that the code may have changed a few times in ways that are not tracked in these commits, but I've found that even these snapshots were a useful reference both in following the tutorial and in my development of a new app since.

Feel free to [contact me](http://melidata.com/contact) or even open an issue if you have questions!
